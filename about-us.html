    <p>Our mission is to work collaboratively to ensure that all students will encourage one another to be responsible, take chances, pursue excellence, and explore their full potential. By being kind, working hard, and making art, combined with a rigorous academic program based on the Common Core standards, our students will become critical thinkers who can excel in society.</p>

    <p>Our vision at the Conservatory of the Arts is to inspire a passion for learning through a multicultural perspective while providing a safe, positive environment where our students can grow socially, academically, and artistically in order to become accountable global citizens.</p>
