  <h1> Chocolate Chip Cookies Example Recipe</h1>
  
  <p> The chocolate chip cookie was invented by American chefs Ruth Graves Wakefield and Sue Brides in 1938.
  They invented the recipe during the period when she owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts. 
  She added chopped up bits from a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie.
  Wakefield gave Nestle the recipe for her cookies and was paid with a lifetime supply of chocolate from the company.
